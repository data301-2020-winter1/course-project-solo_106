## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

My topic of interest of this project is sports and I have decided to work on data relating to players who finished top 20 in their respective sports fields. I have always been interested in sports so, finding this dataset looking through it got me curious about players who made the top 20 one year but may have fallen short of it in the following years.

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

This dataset was provided by Russell Goldenberg and collected from various sources like NBA and WNBA: basketball-reference.com, MLB: FanGraphs etc. It contains data for players who finished top 20 in their respective sport for 8 leagues over 30 years. The dataset has 18 attributes such as id, name, year, team, sportsname, rank etc. with over 10,000 rows.
